# Discord Authentication UI Clone

A pixel-perfect, fully responsive clone of the Discord Sign-Up and Sign-In interfaces. This project demonstrates strict UI slicing, seamless component state management, and the implementation of modern CSS utility frameworks to achieve a 1:1 design replication.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* **Framework:** React (via Vite)
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
* **UI Components:** Flowbite React
* **Typography:** Noto Sans (Discord's official fallback font)

## ✨ Key Features

* **Pixel-Perfect Slicing:** Exact color mapping to Discord's native dark mode (`#313338` & `#1e1f22`).
* **Advanced Styling Control:** Completely overrode default UI library styling and native browser elements (e.g., building a custom interactive checkbox using Tailwind's `peer` utility).
* **State-Driven Routing:** Engineered a seamless, single-page application experience using React hooks (`useState`) to toggle between authentication views without page reloads.
* **Responsive & Accessible:** Built with clean HTML semantics and Tailwind's flexbox layouts for a responsive form structure.

💡 What I Learned
Building this project reinforced my understanding of overriding heavily opinionated UI libraries (like Flowbite) using Tailwind's !important modifiers and peer logic. It also sharpened my ability to translate a complex, real-world design into clean, maintainable React components.

Built with passion and a high attention to detail.
